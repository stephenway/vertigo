*Enough Sass animations and effects to give you vertigo.*

* Requires: Some form of Sass (ruby/libsass)
* This project is very beta so bear with us

## How to Install

Run `bower install --save-dev vertigo` in your project directory.

You will want to add `bower_components/vertigo/scss` to your sass load path, then `@import "vertigo";` in your stylesheet.
